# Release logs

Release logs is a [redmine](http://redmine.org) plugin that helps you keep track of your projects' releases.

## You will find this plugin is useful if:

* you **release** your projects continuously (ex. in a weekly basis)
* you want to **keep track of when an issue was released/rolled back/cancelled** and which other issues were also released at that release
* you want to **send notifications to your colleagues** about the release status
 
## Getting started

Find [**here**](http://www.arubystory.com/p/redmine-release-logs-getting-started.html) a full description of the plugin's functionality and installation & usage guides.
